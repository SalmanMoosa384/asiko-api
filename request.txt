Description
Description:
Develop a feature to automate prospecting by finding the right contacts at targeted companies. This tool will utilize LinkedIn (Sales Navigator, iScraper API) and SERP for data sourcing. It will filter contacts based on specific criteria such as job titles, seniority, and keywords, and provide LinkedIn URLs of matching profiles.

Use Case:
Sales and marketing teams will use this feature to find new people to contact.
After identifying a target company, users will input desired and undesirable titles, seniority levels, keywords, and the required number of profiles.
The feature then generates a list of LinkedIn URLs of individuals who match the set criteria.

Current Solutions:
Currently, prospecting is done manually, requiring significant time to search through LinkedIn or Google.
Sales Navigator and iScraper are used independently, without integration into our system, leading to a disjointed process.
Manual filtering of profiles based on titles, seniority, and keywords, which is time-consuming and prone to human error.
